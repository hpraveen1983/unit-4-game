//Pseudo Coding


//4 crystal and random result


//Every crystal has a random number between 1 and 20



//Either after a win or loss a new random number needs to be generated



//When a crystal is clicked it needs to add the previous result until it equals the random number



//For a loss, sum of all clicks should be greater than random number (loss counter incremented by 1)



//For a win, sum of all clicks should be equal to the random number (win counter incremented by 1)
